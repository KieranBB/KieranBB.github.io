        <h3>I am a solutions-oriented programmer with a background in physics and mathmatics. My broad background gives me a wealth of experience that allows me to approach problems with unique perspectives that allow for adaptability 
            in continuously evolving environments.</h3>
        <h3>Welcome to my website: it includes an exhibition of some of the projects I programmed, and hope you enjoy 
            exploring them as much as I enjoyed making them. Additionally, you'll find my full resume and a link to contact me directly by email. I look forward 
            to hearing from you.</h3>
