            <h2>Dots Game</h2>
            <div style="margin-left: 1em">
                <p>An adaptation of a pen and paper game I recreated from memory. It has rudimentary AI, which I intend to add to for a while. It's possible that another software version of this already exists somewhere, I didn't try to find one.</p>
                <p>The Replit version is a little slow. If you have a Python environment set up, running it locally would be much smoother.</p>

            <h2>Car Paper</h2>
            <div style="margin-left: 1em">
                <p>A paper I wrote for a class modeling a car in terms of how it behaves. One of the more interesting things I've written, and it was fun to work on.</p>
                <a href="./../Files/Math5378CarPaperKBB.pdf">Link to paper.</a>
                <p>I don't mention this in the paper, but there's a natural extension modeling a semi truck by defining the rear axle as the front axle of another (longer) car.
                    The second car would have much stricter restrictions on the allowable angles for the front axle, which add a lot of complications that made me not want to explore it at the time.</p>

            <h2>Replicating Hardy's Test</h2>
            <div style="margin-left: 1em">
                <p>Hardy's test is an experiment meant to show violations of Bell's inequalities, which are predictions of classical physics.
                    This is meaningful, as this type of experiment helps show that, where they intersect, quantum physics predicts reality more accurately than classical physics.
                    There are other tests to show violations of Bell's inequalities, but this is one of the easiest to follow conceptually.
                    While ultimately unsuccessful ourselves, my partner and I identified various problems with previous methodology that helped a later group show the predicted violation.
