            <div style="margin-left: 1em">
            <p>An adaptation of a pen and paper game I recreated from memory. It has rudimentary AI, which I intend to add to for a while. It's possible that another software version of this already exists somewhere, I didn't try to find one.</p>
            <p>The Replit version is a little slow. If you have a Python environment set up, running it locally would be much smoother.</p>
